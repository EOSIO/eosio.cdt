# Guided Installation or Building from Scratch
```sh
$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/eosio/eosio.cdt
$ cd eosio.cdt
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make -j8
```

From here onward you can build your contracts code by simply exporting the `build` directory to your path, so you don't have to install globally (makes things cleaner).
Or you can install globally by running this command

```sh
sudo make install
```

## Uninstall after manual installation

```sh
$ sudo rm -fr /usr/local/eosio.cdt
$ sudo rm -fr /usr/local/lib/cmake/eosio.cdt
$ sudo rm /usr/local/bin/eosio-*
```
