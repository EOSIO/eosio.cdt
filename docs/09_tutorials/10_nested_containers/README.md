### About the scripts

The following 3 Bash scripts are used to collectively test all the cleos commands listed in the comments of
the 5 related .cpp files, which are in the subdirectory tests/toolchain/build-pass/ of eosio.cdt:

* doNestContainer.sh: Test all cleos commands listed in *nestcontn2a.cpp* and *tupletest.cpp*
* doNestContainerKV.sh: Test all cleos commands listed in *nestcontn2kv.cpp*  and *tupletestkv.cpp*
* doTestKVKeys.sh: Test all cleos commands listed in *testkvkeys.cpp*

### About the .abi and .wasm files

Each of the above 5 .cpp files has corresponding .abi and .wasm files generated by the eosio-cpp compiler.
For example, *nestcontn2a.abi* and *nestcontn2a.wasm* are generated by command *eosio-cpp nestcontn2a.cpp*,
These .abi and .wasm files are put in this folder for your reference only.
