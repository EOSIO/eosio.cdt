## Shell Script Files

The following shell script files are used to collectively test all the cleos commands listed in the comments of the related **.cpp* files, which are located in the [eosio.cdt](https://github.com/EOSIO/eosio.cdt/tree/develop) repository, under *[tests/toolchain/build-pass](https://github.com/EOSIO/eosio.cdt/tree/develop/tests/toolchain/build-pass/)* folder:

  * The *[doTestKVKeys.sh](https://github.com/EOSIO/eosio.cdt/tree/develop/docs/09_tutorials/10_nested_containers/files/doTestKVKeys.sh)* file is the script which tests all cleos commands related to *testkvkeys.cpp*
  * The *[doNestContainer.sh](https://github.com/EOSIO/eosio.cdt/tree/develop/docs/09_tutorials/10_nested_containers/sripts/doNestContainer.sh)* file is the script which tests all cleos commands related to *nestcontn2a.cpp* and *tupletest.cpp*
  * The *[doNestContainerKV.sh](https://github.com/EOSIO/eosio.cdt/tree/develop/docs/09_tutorials/10_nested_containers/files/doNestContainerKV.sh)* file is the script which tests all cleos commands related to *nestcontn2kv.cpp* and *tupletestkv.cpp*

## ABI and WASM Files

In the same *[docs/09_tutorials/10_nested_containers/files](https://github.com/EOSIO/eosio.cdt/tree/develop/docs/09_tutorials/10_nested_containers/files)* folder you can find the *.abi* and *.wasm* files which are generated by *eosio-cpp* compiler from the previously mentioned **.cpp* source files and are uploaded for reference.
