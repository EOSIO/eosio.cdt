Contracts are able to use `uint64_t` error codes as an alternative (and cheaper) means of signaling error conditions as opposed to string error messages. However, EOSIO and EOSIO.CDT reserve certain ranges of the `uint64_t` value space for their own purposes. They assume that the contract develop respects the following restrictions:

1. 0 (inclusive) to 5,000,000,000,000,000,000 (exclusive): Available for contract developers to use to signal errors specific to their contracts.

2. 5,000,000,000,000,000,000 (inclusive) to 8,000,000,000,000,000,000 (exclusive): Reserved for the EOSIO.CDT compiler to allocate as appropriate. Although the WASM code generated by the EOSIO.CDT compiler may use error code values that were automatically generated from within this range, the error codes in this range are meant to have meaning specific to the particular compiled contract (the meaning would typically be conveyed through the mapping between the error code value and strings in the associated generated ABI file).

3. 8,000,000,000,000,000,000 (inclusive) to 10,000,000,000,000,000,000 (exclusive): Reserved for the EOSIO.CDT compiler to allocate as appropriate. The error codes in this range are not specific to any contract but rather are used to convey general runtime error conditions associated with the generated code by EOSIO.CDT.

4. 10,000,000,000,000,000,000 (inclusive) to 18,446,744,073,709,551,615 (inclusive): Reserved for EOSIO to represent system-level error conditions. EOSIO will actually enforce this by restricting the ability for `eosio_assert_code` to be used to fail with error code values used within this range.
