# EOSIO.CDT (Contract Development Toolkit)
## Version : 1.2.1

EOSIO.CDT is a toolchain for WebAssembly (WASM) and set of tools to facilitate contract writing for the EOSIO platform.  In addition to being a general purpose WebAssembly toolchain, [EOSIO](https://github.com/eosio/eos) specific optimizations are available to support building EOSIO smart contracts.  This new toolchain is built around [Clang 7](https://github.com/eosio/llvm), which means that EOSIO.CDT has the most currently available optimizations and analyses from LLVM, but as the WASM target is still considered experimental, some optimizations are not available or incomplete.

## New Features from EOSIO
- Compile (-c) option flag will compile to a WASM-elf object file
- ranlib and ar support for static libraries for WASM
- \_\_FILE\_\_ and \_\_BASE\_FILE\_\_ will now only return the file name and not the fullpath. This eliminates any non-determinism from location of the compiled binary
- Global constructors and global destructors are now supported

- _eosio-cpp_, _eosio-cc_, _eosio-ld_, _eosio-pp_, and _eosio_abigen_ are set the core set of tools that you will interact with.
    * These are the C++ compiler, C compiler, linker, postpass tool and ABI generator.
- A simple CMake interface to build EOSIO smart contracts against EOSIO.CDT

### Guided Installation
First clone

```sh
$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/eosio/eosio.cdt
$ cd eosio.cdt
```

Now run `build.sh` and give the core symbol for the EOSIO blockchain that intend to deploy to.
    *`build.sh` will install any dependencies that are needed.
```sh
$ ./build.sh
```

Finally, install the build
    *This install will install the core to ```/usr/local/eosio.cdt``` and symlinks to the top level tools (compiler, ld, etc.) to ```/usr/local/bin```
```sh
$ sudo ./install.sh
```

### Building your first smart contract
- Navigate to the hello folder in examples (./examples/hello).
- You should then see the hello.cpp file
- Now run the compiler
```sh
$ eosio-cpp hello.cpp -o hello.wasm
```
- As of this release abi generation is not available.

#### Optional, if you know cmake
- If you want to test out the CMake system, stay in the same directory as the previous manual build.
- Then create a build directory ```mkdir build``` and cd into that directory ```cd build```
- Then run ```cmake ../```, this will generate the cache and supporting files for CMake to do it's job.
- Now simply run ```make```.
- You should now have a `hello` file in the build directory, this is the wasm file,  if you would like to use ```cleos set contract``` and you need to change the name to have the .wasm extension that is perfectly fine, or you can change the add_executable target name to ```hello.wasm```, or you can use ```cleos set code <path-to-compiled-wasm>/hello``` to load the file to the blockchain , without the .wasm extension.

### How to use eosio-abigen
#### using with eosio-cpp
To generate an abi with ```eosio-cpp```, the only flag you need to pass to ```eosio-cpp``` is `-abigen`, this will tell the compiler to run `eosio-abigen` after compilation and linking stages.  If the output filename is specified as a '.wasm' file with the `-o` option (e.g. \<filename\>.wasm) then eosio-cpp will tell the abi generator to create the abi with the name \<filename\>.abi, if no '.wasm' suffix is used then the resulting output filename is still \<filename\>.abi

Example:
```bash
$ eosio-cpp hello.cpp -o hello.wasm --abigen
```
This will generate two files:
* The compiled binary wasm (hello.wasm)
* The generated abi file (hello.abi)

#### using eosio-abigen alone
To generate an abi with ```eosio-abigen```, only requires that you give the main '.cpp' file to compile and the output filename `--output`.

Example:
```bash
$ eosio-abigen hello.cpp --output=hello.abi
```

This will generate one file:
* The generated abi file (hello.abi)

### Difference from old abi generator
Unlike the old abi generator tool, the new tool uses C++11 or GNU style attributes to mark ```actions``` and ```tables```.

Example (four ways to declare an action for ABI generation):
```c++
// this is the C++11 and greater style attribute
[[eosio::action]]
void testa( account_name n ) {
	// do something
}

// this is the GNU style attribute, this can be used in C code and prior to C++ 11
__attribute__((eosio_action))
void testa( account_name n ){
	// do something
}

struct [[eosio::action]] testa {
	account_name n;
    EOSLIB_SERIALIZE( testa, (n) )
};

struct __attribute__((eosio_action)) testa {
	account_name n;
    EOSLIB_SERIALIZE( testa, (n) )
};
```
If your action name is not a valid [EOSIO name](https://developers.eos.io/eosio-cpp/docs/naming-conventions) you can explicitly specify the name in the attribute ```c++ [[eosio::action("<valid action name>")]]```

Example (Two ways to declare a table for abi generation):
```c++
struct [[eosio::table]] testtable {
	uint64_t owner;
  	/* all other fields */
};

struct __attribute__((eosio_table)) testtable {
	uint64_t owner;
    /* all other fields */
};

typedef eosio::multi_index<N(tablename), testtable> testtable_t;
```
If you don't want to use the multi-index you can explicitly specify the name in the attribute ```c++ [[eosio::table("<valid action name>")]]```

For an example contract of abi generation please see the file ./examples/abigen_test/test.cpp, you can generate the abi for this file with `eosio-abigen test.cpp --output=test.abi`.

### Fixing an ABI, or Writing an ABI
- The sections to the abi are pretty simple to understand and the syntax is purely JSON, so we are going to write our own ABI file.
- Even after ABI generation is available, an important note should be made that the generator will never be completely perfect for every contract written, advanced features of the newest version of the ABI will require manual construction of the ABI, and odd and advanced C++ patterns could capsize the generators type deductions, so having a good knowledge of how to write an ABI should be an essential piece of knowledge of a smart contract writer.
- Please refer to [developers.eos.io "How to write an abi"](https://developers.eos.io/eosio-cpp/docs/how-to-write-an-abi), to learn about the different sections of an ABI.

### Usage
---
To compile an EOSIO smart contract, the perferred method is to use the template CMakeLists.txt in the examples folder.
For example:
```CMakeLists.txt```
```
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.5)
project(test_example VERSION 1.0.0)

if(EOSIO_CDT_ROOT STREQUAL "" OR NOT EOSIO_CDT_ROOT)
    set(EOSIO_CDT_ROOT "/usr/local/eosio.cdt")
endif()
list(APPEND CMAKE_MODULE_PATH ${EOSIO_CDT_ROOT}/lib/cmake)
include(EosioWasmToolchain)

add_executable( test.wasm test.cpp )
```
```test.cpp```
```
#include <eosiolib/eosio.hpp>
using namespace eosio;
class test : public eosio::contract {
public:
   using contract::contract;
   [[eosio::action]]
   void testact( account_name test ) {
   }
};
EOSIO_ABI( test, (testact))
```

Since, EosioWasmToolchain overwrites `cmake` to cross-compile WASM, standard cmake commands of _add\_executable/ add\_library_ can then be used.  Also note, the __EOSIO_CDT_ROOT__ variable, this needs to be set if you decided to install to the non-default location.

To manually compile source code:
Use ```eosio-cpp/eosio-cc``` and ```eosio-ld``` as if it were __clang__ and __lld__ , with all includes and options specific to EOSIO and CDT being baked in.
